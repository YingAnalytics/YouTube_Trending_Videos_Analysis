Team Members: Maraline Torres, Ying Zhang, Bruce Hou, Yuting Gong, Yujia Cao <br>
Programming Language: SQL for phase 1 and Python for Phase 2<br><br>



<h2>Project objective: </h2>
    
Our goal is to analyze US and Japan YouTube trending videos and present how the video categories and country culture correlate with the videoâ€™s popularity in 2018 and 2020. 
We will analyze the characteristics, including categories, view, likes count and trending time (season/weekday/month), in trending 
videos to identify changes in preference. 



<h2> Data source:</h2>

Initially, we had four different tables with the videos information and two tables that contain the video categories information. <br/>


`ba775-team-6a.youtube.US_youtube_trending_data`,
`ba775-team-6a.youtube.US_youtube_trending_data_past`,
`ba775-team-6a.youtube.JP_youtube_trending_data`,
`ba775-team-6a.youtube.JP_youtube_trending_data_past`,
`ba775-team-6a.youtube.US_video_categories`,
`ba775-team-6a.youtube.JP_video_categories`

We decided to put all the information in one table which is the one that we used in our queries and visualizations:<br/>

`ba775-team-6a.youtube.Youtube_trending_videos`<br/><br/>

<h2> Tableau Story  </h2>

In addition to the following exploratory analysis using SQL, our team also created different dashaboards and put it all together in a story. Please feel free to use the following link to access our story:

<h2> Reference to datasource:</h2>

This datasource was collected using the Youtube  and it presents a list of the top trending videos on the platform. To determine the year's top-trending videos, Youtube uses a combination of factors such as number of views, shares, comments and likes. We accessed the datasources via Kaggle data notebooks  "Trending Yotube Video Statistics" and "YouTube Trending Video Dataset". <br/><br/>
